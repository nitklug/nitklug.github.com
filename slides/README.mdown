License
-------

Slippy is licensed under the New BSD License, which means you can do pretty much anything you want with it - However, I encourage you to share your slides and stylesheets if you make some, but there is no obligation whatsoever.

New BSD License - see the src/LICENSE file for details

Compatibility
-------------

It should work with all browsers, except for the overview function that does not work in IE8 and below.
