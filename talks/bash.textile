h2. notes

<(#notes)* the talk might have gone over the head of newcomers to shell scripting, sorry about that. maybe you can still draw from the talk if you start learning bash now.
* the errors in the slides are now fixed
* the talk didn't teach you how to make a bash script in the first place using hashbangs
  you can find a simple step-by-step howto on the same at "ehow":http://www.ehow.com/how_5070774_write-bash-script-unix.html
* some more content i intended to add to the slides have been added
